# Kobold Dungeon Tester

This is a text-adventure-roguelike. It's meant to be played like any multiple-choice-text-adventure ("choose your own adventure" is currently a trademark, so we have to dance around what we mean). The dungeon is generated randomly and the rooms are homemade text adventures whose timeline advances each time the room is revisited.

A few writers expressed interest in this project so I've put the project online so it can be understood and improved.

I currently lack the will to do so. (I like writing but this is waaay too much work for something in my spare time.)
